This dir contains examples from Peirce's SF book, whereas the systems
come from TAPL. 

All samples are (buggy) variations on basic systems, such that
determinism, preservation and/or progress may fail

c8/ (chapter 8 in TAPL): the language
of typed arithmetic (no binders).  SF's chapter: Types.v

Failure of subject expansion:
  aprolog -check-n* tyarith.apl subexp.apl

Variations: 

  aprolog -check-n* tyarith.apl var*.apl check.apl


c9/ (chapter 8 in TAPL9: simply-typed lambda calculus with booleans)

see also SF's: StlcProp.v chapter

aprolog    -check-n* stlc.apl   var*.apl check.apl

to check the 3 properties, except var3, which, missing one rule, it is re-implemented as 

aprolog    -check-n* var3.apl  check.apl


---------------------
The tool finds all the counterexample mentioned in all the
exercises.
