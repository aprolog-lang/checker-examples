Harper, R. and Pfenning, F. 2005.
On equivalence and canonical forms in the LF type theory.
ACM Trans. Comput. Logic 6, 1, 61â€“101.

From the command line, to use NF type

aprolog -check-nf lf-eq.apl  check.apl

To use NE

aprolog -check-ne -l lf-eq.apl check.apl 

For NE^-

aprolog -check-ne-minus -l lf-eq.apl check.apl


The properties checked are lemmas 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5, syntactic properties of the
algorithmic equivalence judgment from the paper.
